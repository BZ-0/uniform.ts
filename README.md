# 🥋 uniform.ts 🥋

Replacement of all my web workers libraries.

## ❌ Coming NOT so soon... ❌

At this point, I've completely lost my talent and ability to develop projects like this. I don't know when it will all come back to me (probably never), but I think that this project in a new guise will be released very soon. I'm sorry.

## 🔖 What was wrong with that project? 🔖

A flawed architecture that in no way implies normal use of `@` properties, meaning they are completely blocked by this library. And unfortunately, this vice is fixed and cannot be changed in any way except by rewriting it from scratch.

## 🥀 And what's new won't there be? 🥀

Probably not anymore. My dementia is progressing much faster than all my attempts at development.

## 😌 Fortunately, there is some good news. 😌

I'm moving some usable parts of my given library into separate components of another sub-project.
